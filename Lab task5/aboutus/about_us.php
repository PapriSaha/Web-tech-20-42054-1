        <p class="justify">
            Crowdfunding powers membership businesses for creators by giving them the tools they need to acquire, manage, and energize their paying patrons. With a subscription-style payment model, fans pay their favorite creators a monthly amount of their choice in exchange for exclusive access, extra content, or a closer look into their creative journey.
This model is a win-win; creators retain creative freedom while getting the salary they deserve, and fans get to rest easy knowing that their money goes directly towards creating more of what they love.

                        Our core behaviors were crafted by our first two dozen employees. To this day, as our company grows, we use them as our guiding light toward maintaining the culture we’ve built and love.
